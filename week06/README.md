### Address Space
* virtual vs physical address spaces
### Address Translation
* virtual => physical by MMU with help of OS
### Base and Bound
* base register stored the starting address of process in RAM
* bound may store the size of the process or the last address (depends)
### Segmentation
* base and bound for each segment
* to get rid of internal fragmentation
### Free Space Management
* pain in the ass when we use segmentation or base+bound methods
